# 2023 Annual Report: WG LTS

## Current initiatives and Project Health


1. What work did the WG do this year that should be highlighted?

During 2023, we worked to restart the WG after [discussion at KCS EU 2023](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C7utWMjGpDcBc5TB_ooddERsid59sFLC7gqLzyS5aKY/edit?usp=sharing).

We also designed and published a [survey](https://bit.ly/k8s-upgrade-survey) to capture pain points and better understand challenges Kubernetes users face with upgrading. We collected 223 survey responses. From this data, we identified some  areas where we can better communicate improvements that have already been made to the project. We plan to work on several of these during 2024 and will present analyzed results from the survey to the community and sponsoring SIGs during 2024. 

Some of these include blog posts around:

* How upgrades are easier/safer now
* How to do upgrades that are less disruptive
* Work the community has done around production readiness
* Building empathy for users and avoiding breaking changes

We hosted a [maintainer track session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fngdOlwZtQ) at KubeCon NA in Chicago to discuss what the working group wanted to achieve.

We have been meeting on a bi-weekly cadence, but have not provided updates to the sponsoring SIGs as most of 2023 was spent forming and drafting the survey. We will provide updates to the sponsoring SIGS during 2024.   


2. Did you have community-wide updates in 2023 (e.g. KubeCon talks)?
