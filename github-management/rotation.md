# GitHub Management Rotation

GitHub Management Rotation refers to a rotation program both for the
[GitHub Administration Team] and the [New Membership Coordinators].
Rotations are volunteer-driven and best-effort during business hours only.
The GitHub Management team is spread across the globe so please keep timezones
in mind while expecting responses from the rotating member.

The rotation program is **not equivalent to oncall** and our SLO remains
one week.

## Rotation Schedule

You can find the rotation schedule and the current rotating member at this [calendar].
To know a member's timezone and GitHub username, please refer to [README.md].

As a reminder, please reach out to the appropriate team depending on your request.

| Role | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| [GitHub Administration Team] | Repository creation or migration, security, moderation, etc |
| [New Membership Coordinators] | New Membership Requests |

## Managing the Rotation Schedule

This section is meant for the GitHub Management team.

Each rotation is for one week. If you would be unavailable during
your assigned rotation schedule, you should swap with another member or
find coverage for that week.

To update the schedule, directly update this [google calendar]. Only GitHub Admins
and NMCs have access to update this calendar.

### Handoff

When your shift ends, you may be involved in one or more ongoing
issues. If you are already invested in the issues and have the bandwidth
for it, you can continue managing the issue (thanks!), but _you are not
obligated to continue managing the issue!_

If you would like to handoff issue command:

1.  Start by **ensuring the tracking issue is up to date** - review the
    information in the issue description, and fill in or correct any missing
    details.
2.  **Leave a comment** to add any additional context you have on the
    issue. Make sure to list any open questions or decisions and any pending
    action items.
3.  Reassign the issue to the next rotating member.

Finally, reach out to the next rotating member (email/slack) to make
sure they are aware of the handoff and to answer any questions. _Until they've
explicitly acknowledged the handoff you are still the issue commander!_
