# Kubernetes.io analytics data

This folder holds CSV files of Google Universal Analytics reports collected from April 21, 2015 and August 13, 2022. Google has [sunset Universal Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en#export&zippy=%2Chow-can-i-export-data-from-my-universal-analytics-property) and to keep the data we've moved it into this folder. Given the large amount of data, we chose to export only a subset of the data like total page views, top pages by views, top search terms, and some other reports.

 [top-pages-by-pageviews.csv](/top-blogs-by-pageview.csv) has a table for the top 500 pages by views for the date range and a table with the total number of pageviews for each day in the range. 

[top-blogs-by-pageviews.csv](/top-blogs-by-pageviews.csv) has a table for the top 500 blogs by views for the date range and the total pageviews for URLs that include '/blogs' for each day in the range.

[top-search-terms.csv](/top-search-terms.csv) has a table for the top 500 search terms for the date range and a table with the total searches done on each day in the range.
